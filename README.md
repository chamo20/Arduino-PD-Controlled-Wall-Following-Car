## Project Overview: Autonomous Wall-Following Robot

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my competition winning Autonomous Wall-Following Robot, which triumphed in all 6 rounds of a recent competitive robotics tournament. This repository contains all the code, design schematics, and documentation necessary to understand and replicate the project.

### Key Components:
- **Arduino Uno**: Serves as the brain of the robot, orchestrating all control functions.
- **VL53L0X Time of Flight (ToF) Sensor**: Provides high-accuracy distance measurements to maintain a precise distance from the wall.
- **N20 Gear Motors**: Delivers reliable and consistent propulsion, allowing for precise movement and control.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Manages motor operations, enabling fine control over the robot’s speed and direction.

### Winning Strategy:
The robot's success was underpinned by a robust Proportional-Derivative (PD) control system, finely tuned to respond dynamically to the proximity of the wall. This allowed for exceptionally smooth navigation around bends and straight paths, adapting in real-time to any deviations from the set track. Strategic enhancements in motor control algorithms compensated for variations in battery charge levels, ensuring consistent performance throughout the competition.

This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive look at the engineering and programming prowess that went into developing a top-performing autonomous robot. Whether you're a fellow robotics enthusiast, a researcher, or someone curious about autonomous control systems, you’ll find valuable insights and resources here.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the designs, and reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on future projects!
